While many elections are effectively two horse races, any number of candidates can be chosen in this app. After the candidate names are submitted, states/provinces are created. Each state has assigned 'points' that work like Electoral College votes, the state must also be assigned a percentage representing each candidate's chance of victory in that state.</p><p>After the state creation is completed, the final calculations are performed. Nc ^ Ns scenarios are tested where Ns is equal to the number of states, and Nc is equal to the number of candidates. The victor (or victors) for each scenario is determined and the victor's chances of winning are increased by the percent chance of that scenario occuring. The <a href='http://bluff.jcoglan.com/api.html'>Bluff API</a> was then used to convert the data into a pie graph giving a visual representation of each candidate's chance of winning.</p>" %}
