	<p>Welcome to my website! My name is Stephen Walsh, I'm a recent graduate who is interested in obtaining a position in software development. I graduated from Western University in 2015 with a Bachelor's of Engineering Science in Electrical Engineering. After spending some time travelling I began work at Miipe Quality Assurance as a Test Analyst. I decided to leave Miipe in June of 2016 in order to pursue a career in Software Development and have since been working on personal projects in order to create a professional portfolio.</p>
	<p>I was first introduced to programming during a course in the first year of my undergraduate degree. I was immediately fascinated by the subject which created an interest in software development that lasted throughout my time at Western. Upon graduating, I decided that I would like to pursue the practice professionally and began looking for jobs in the software development industry. I believe that the courses were extremely valuable to my personal development as a programmer as they covered many of the fundamental and more academic concepts in programming such as OOP, algorithmic complexity, data structures, etc. giving me a formal background in the discipline and provided me with the tools required to practice the subject independently.</p>
	<p>My responsibilities at Miipe quality assurance were mainly related to software quality assurance. This involved the identification and reporting of bugs, reading requirements and creating test cases, as well as the testing of new applications and fixes. In order to reduce the amount of manual work required for each cycle of regression tests that we performed, we developed our own automated tests using the Selenium Java library. This was one of my secondary responsibilities and was my first experience working with a large code base in a professional environment. Our development process for creating these tests consisted of writing a document detailing the process used in each automated test case, the development of a method which performs these processes and raises a notification if the system no longer acts as it is expected to, and the integration of this new method into our main codebase with all other completed methods.</p>
	<p>While I was excited to have a chance to use my programming skills in a professional environment, and enjoyed my time working on the automation project, I eventually found the scope of the project to be somewhat limited and felt that I had learned all I could from the experience. This led to the decision to pursue a more challenging role dedicated to software development elsewhere.</p>
	<p>This purpose of this site is to serve as a professional portfolio, containing several projects I've completed. These projects are meant to demonstrate creative thinking and logical problem solving abilities, as well as the required skill with various languages and tools to implement my ideas. Also included is a contact page, which contains methods to contact me personally, as well as links to accounts I hold on other sites.</p>
